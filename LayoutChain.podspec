  spec.description  = <<-DESC
LayoutChain has simple intuitive syntax and decreased compilation time of views layout setup. Easy access to creating single constraint and features to setup own UIStackView with a little amount of constraints.
The idea was to create lightweight wrapper on AutoLayout without lossing access to native API. Other frameworks may have a lot of generics and operators overload that can significantly increase the time for type-checking during compilation. Some frameworks has complex API to construct layout but even do not has simple functions to take a single constraint for its managing.
